# If you are building your code for production
# This command is similar to npm install, except it’s meant to be used in automated environments
# such as test platforms, continuous integration, and deployment – or any situation where you want
# to make sure you’re doing a clean install of your dependencies. It can be significantly faster
# than a regular npm install by skipping certain user-oriented features.
# It is also more strict than a regular install, which can help catch errors or inconsistencies caused by the incrementally-installed local environments of most npm users.
