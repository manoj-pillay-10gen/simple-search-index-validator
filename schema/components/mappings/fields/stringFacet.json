Atlas Search doesn't apply the analyzer when indexing `string` fields for faceting.\n\nAtlas Search only supports [facet](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-search/facet/#std-label-fts-facet-ref) queries against fields indexed as the `stringFacet` type. To perform a normal search also on the same field, you must index the field as type `string` also.",
